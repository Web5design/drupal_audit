Drupal Audit
============

This shell script allows a quick "audit" of a website, giving some details about the configuration:
- drush status
- hacked status (using Hacked module)
- modules & themes status
- cache status (using Cacheaudit module)
- database volumetry indications
- phpinfo()
- ...

There still is a lot to do, pull requests are totally welcome!
